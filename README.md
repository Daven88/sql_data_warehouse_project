# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

This repository showcases an end-to-end data warehouse and analytics solution built using SQL Server.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate modern data engineering fundamentals — from ingesting raw CSV data to designing a star schema, building a warehouse, and generating insights using SQL.

This project was inspired by Baraa Alomari’s SQL Server data warehouse tutorial series, adapted and extended in my own style for learning and portfolio purposes.

## Project Overview 

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

The purpose of the project is to build a small but realistic data warehouse suitable for analytical reporting.
It covers:

- Data ingestion
- Data cleaning
- Data transformation
- Data modelling (star schema)
- Analytical SQL queries
- Documentation

This project reflects industry best practices and demonstrates my growing skills in data engineering, SQL, and analytics.

### 1. Data Warehouse Development (Data Engineering)

#### Objective

Create a SQL Server–based data warehouse that integrates data from multiple systems and supports analytical reporting.
These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.

#### Key Steps

#### Data Sources
Two datasets representing an ERP and CRM system, supplied as CSV files.

#### Data Cleaning & Quality Checks
Handling missing values, correcting data types, resolving inconsistencies, and enforcing referential integrity.

#### Data Integration
Consolidating both datasets into staging tables, transforming them, and loading them into a dimensional model.

#### Data Model
Star schema including:
- Fact table (Sales)
- Dimension tables (Customer, Product, Date, etc.)

#### Assumptions
 - Only current records are required (no historical tracking).
 - Focus is on analytical readiness rather than operational reporting.

#### Documentation
ERD diagrams and process notes are provided to support stakeholders and demonstrate understanding of warehouse design.

### 2. BI & Analytics (Data Analytics)
#### Objective
Develop SQL queries that generate insights for business stakeholders.
#### Insight Areas
#### - Customer behaviour
Segmentation, repeat purchasing, customer value.
#### - Product performance
Best-selling categories, product profitability, trends.
#### - Sales trends
Time-series analysis, seasonality, regional performance.
The analytics layer demonstrates how the warehouse supports decision-making.
